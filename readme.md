# React tech assignment - CliqDigital ðŸŒ¦

In this assignment, you are required to implement a weather app based on a Figma design, using React.
Users can enter a city's name, and we will display the current weather, a five-day forecast, and daily evolution. Users can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius for current weather.

Create a repository on your GitHub and push the assignment to it. Then, send us the link to your repository.
